# Exploring modern DevOps

This repository is built as a resource for developers and other DevOps professionals to build core skills on creating and deploying software with GitHub. The repository contains an application written using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) backend, and the beginnings of end-to-end testing with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## Required resources

### Local development

To run the project locally, you will need the following resources:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

Alternatively, you could use a [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) by moving the [.devcontainer solution](./what-the-hack/Coach/.devcontainer) folder to the root of the project and opening the project with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Cloud deployment

The workshop contains the necessary files to deploy the project to [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/overview) with a [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/introduction) backend. You can use your Azure account to perform these steps, or [create a trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Formats

### Challenge-based

Many learners find the best results if they explore technology by performing the tasks without step-by-step instructions. To support this style, we have built a workshop using a format modeled from Microsoft's What the Hack. A set of challenges is provided in the [Student folder](./what-the-hack/Student/), where you begin by first opening the project and progressing through a set of tasks typical of a developer using DevOps processes.

**[Begin the challenge-based workshop!](./what-the-hack/README.md)**

> The [Coach folder](./what-the-hack/Coach/) contains the solution. This is to be used by the mentors at your event, or if you get stuck.

### Step-by-step

A [step-by-step workshop](./guided-workshop/) is currently being built.
