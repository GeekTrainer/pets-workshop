# Exploring modern DevOps

This repository is built as a resource for developers and other DevOps professionals to build core skills on creating and deploying software with GitHub. The repository contains an application written using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) backend, and the beginnings of end-to-end testing with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## Formats

### Challenge-based

Many learners find the best results if they explore technology by performing the tasks without step-by-step instructions. To support this style, we have built a workshop using a format modeled from Microsoft's What the Hack. A set of challenges is provided in the [Student folder](./what-the-hack/Student/), where you begin by first opening the project and progressing through a set of tasks typical of a developer using DevOps processes. Solution files and other tips are available in the [Coach folder](./what-the-hack/Coach/), including a couple of [resource files](./what-the-hack/Coach/resources).

### Step-by-step

If you prefer a more guided experience, you can work through the [step-by-step workshop](./guided-workshop/). The workshop contains step-by-step instructions to complete the tasks and supporting information to learn more about the technology.
