You've made it to the end of the one hour workshop. Congratulations! You've explored the core skills to help you get the most out of GitHub Copilot. From here you can explore various challenges on your own, and see how GitHub Copilot can support you as you continue developing.

The suggestions listed here are exactly that - suggestions. You're free to come up with your own scenarios or features you think the application should have.

You'll also notice there aren't step-by-step instructions here. You've already seen how you can use Copilot to aid you in development. Part of the challenge put forth with these extra suggestions is to apply what you've learned to create code!

## Potential next steps

Here's some ideas of how you could continue to grow and build upon what you've done:

- Return to the API endpoints you updated previously in Flask and add unit tests.
- Add paging support to the full list of dogs or any results page with more than 5 results.
- Add a form to allow a user to apply to adopt a dog if the dog is available.
- Add a form to allow users to register a dog they found.
