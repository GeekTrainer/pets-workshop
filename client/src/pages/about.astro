          Nestled in the heart of Seattle, Tailspin Shelter is a warm, welcoming haven for dogs of all breeds and backgrounds. Founded in 2015 by a small group of dog lovers and rescue advocates, our mission is to give every dog a second chance at a happy, healthy life. Whether it's finding forever homes, providing medical care, or offering behavioral training, our dedicated team works tirelessly to ensure each dog's journey has a joyful destination. Inspired by Seattle's vibrant and compassionate community, we've grown from a small foster network into a full-service shelter and adoption center.

          The name "Tailspin" reflects both the whirlwind of emotions dogs often experience when they first arrive â€” and the joyful, spinning tails we see when they find their perfect match. For us, a "tailspin" is a reminder of the transformations we witness daily: from uncertainty and fear to trust, love, and boundless energy. It's this journey that fuels our work and reminds us why we do what we do. Every wagging tail is a testament to resilience and hope.
