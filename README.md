# Pets workshop

This repository contains the project for a guided workshop to explore modern DevOps with GitHub. The project is a website for a fictional dog shelter, with a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) backend using [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/) frontend using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for dynamic pages. The design is to be used as a walk-through of GitHub features, including [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview), [Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions) and [GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-github-advanced-security). You'll explore how to use these features to implement and improve your organization's DevOps processes.
